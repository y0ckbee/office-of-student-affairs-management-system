"""
Management command to check for expired meetings and send notifications.

This command should be run periodically (e.g., via cron job) to:
1. Check all scheduled meetings that have passed their deadline
2. Mark them as expired if the student didn't meet
3. Send notifications to both student and OSA Coordinator
4. Log the activity

Usage:
    python manage.py check_expired_meetings

Recommended cron schedule (every 15 minutes):
    */15 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py check_expired_meetings
